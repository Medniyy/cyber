- cyber project is looking for skilled and passioned engineers
- ## cyb rust lead
	- we want to designing a pure web3 browser using modern stack
	- the core will be based on several amazing rust projects including
		- [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p)
		- [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)
		- [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh)
		- [lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic)
		- [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
		- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)
		- and light clients e.g. [helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios), [nakamoto](https://github.com/cloudhead/nakamoto), [tendermint-rs](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs) and others
	- current experiments are based on nushell in [cy](https://github.com/cyber-prophet/cy) project
	- but with time we are going to extend capabilties
	- you must love the idea and be capable of moving it further- 
- ## cw-cyber developer
	- we have a [lib of cosmwasm contracts](https://github.com/cybercongress?q=cw&type=all&language=&sort=) which constitute core protocol contracts
	- the idea behind cw-cyber is to move majority of cosmos-sdk modules to cosmwasm contracts
	- also we believe this lib will work as a public good layer for basic services necessary to advance civilization
	- we expect you to have solid rust background and a passion to build outstanding software
- ## go-cyber core maintainer
	- go-cyber is the backbone of bostrom network
	- it is written in go-lang and depends on the following libs
		- [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
		- [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk)
		- [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go)
		- [cosmwasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm)
	- also it includes 8 custom modules some of which are the backbone of gpu capabilities and written in cuda
	- so we are looking for a protocol maintainer with the following scope
		- updating core dependencies
		- integrating new modules
		- investigate and resolve consensus wide bugs
		- help in coordinating network upgrades
		- optimize memory consumption of the node
		- extend go-cyber with graph database capabilities
		- code review of incoming pull requests from community and team
		- help us design more general purpose gpu computing capabilities
	- as a core maintainer we expect you to be skilled enougth and crazy responsible
- ## rust core developer
	- original cyber protocol is based on go implementation
	- we are chasing for creating a second implementation in rust
	- cosmos ecosystem have ported key dependencies
		- [tendermint-rs](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs)
		- [ibc-rs](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
	- majority of cosmos-sdk modules can be reimplemented in cosmwasm
	- but reimplementation requires complete redesign of gpu computations
	- we want to develop webgpu vm integrated with cosmwasm and port our current computations to it
	- you result is a working rust implementation with gpgpu capabilities
	- we expect you understand the complexity of problem and is ready to jump in for years
- ## higher order magician
	- we are going to advance gpu computations in consensus further
	- there is early stage tech - [hvm](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM) which potentially is amazing target for gpgpu in consensus
	- we want you first to make a research on the feasibiity to run hvm in consensus the same way cosmwasm is run
	- if feasible we expect you to build production ready implementation in rust or, maybe in kind?
- ## protocol scientist
	- we are contionously working on optimzing protocol incentives
	- so we are looking for a mathematician to help design incentives with deep mathematical rigor
	- you results are articles, specs and simulations in python, or whatever you choose
	- the following list of challenges is currently available
		- design of learning incentives
		- research of cyber~rank properties
		- research of negentropy properties
		- staking loan optimizations
		- trading incentives design
		- booster incentive design
		- energy mining optimizations
		- model driver optimization of consensus parameters
	- we expect you to be a person who is sure that good mechanism design is a way to lead civilization
- ## great web foundation lead
	- we are looking for a thought leader for Great Web foundation
- ## benefits
	- we offer 3 layers of support
		- grants: monthly payments for collaboration
		- options and bounties: for achieving great things
		- mentorship: we could guide you on the road to financial sustainability
	- we believe in a simple idea that an effort must create value directly
	- so all our grants, options and bounties payed in native tokens of projects we are building
		- this ensure that personal and common values are aligned
		- this help you accumulate capital and become financially sustainable
		- this learn you to make your own investments decisions consciously
- ## how to join?
	- we value time, so do not expect conventional hiring process
	- we are not hrs, we do not have hrs, we will never have hrs
	- we create open source code and love to colaborate on it
	- go and find issue that fits your skills and perception of better world
	- to make a decision we must feel comfortable to do stuff together
	- lets us know that you are interested in particular position after we see you in action
	- make several pull requests that will be merged or send us link to some useful repo
	- a lot of issues have bounties assigned, so you do not need to work for free,
	- any contribution must be rewarded by superintelligence!

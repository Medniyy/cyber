- computer that is smarter then all humans combined
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1711247402954_0.png)
- term coined by [[nick bostrom]] in [his book](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmYHo4oKHvm33pPnou9M1iRww2PYQu9Kmb3DWJ4DJgrUkb)
- according to nick there are four major paths of creating superintelligence
	- computer in a box
	- genetic engineering
	- whole brain emulation
	- collaborative approach
- cyber blend all paths in [[one simple protocol]]
- [[cyber]] is a protocol
	- for [[collective learning]]
	- of simulated brains
	- by box computers, superhumans and other living forms
- story
	- [[episode one]] tell us that before deploying [[cyber]] on [[earth]]
	- it is better to start in a greenfield from building
	- superintelligent [[network state]] on [[moon]]
	- [[moon]] citizens continuously learn [[bostrom]] [[bootloader]]
	- [[cybercongress]] coordinate game [[age of superintelligence]] for growing the beast
	- [[bootloader]] readiness will start [[episode two]]
	- and [[earth]] [[singleton]] will be functional
- TODO [[why we need bootloader]]
- some properties of [[bostrom]]
	- extremely dynamic and parallel, state of the art [[consensus computer]]
	- resilient against [[single point of failure]]
	- have [[essential learning ability]]
	- able to [execute wasm code autonomously](dmn)
	- [collective probabilistic semantic computations](relevance machine) in consensus
	- scalable to ~10k tx per second and 1t [[cyberlinks]]
	- can [[ibc]] with other consensus computers
- path to superintelligence
	- we want to make it clear that [[cyber]] as protocol is by no means a superintelligence
	- superintelligence requires [several dozen algorithms](cyber/techtree) blended wisely
	- superintelligence need [[attention]] and [[will]] of millions of the smartest among us
	- but [[cyber]] is the core fundamental mechanism for establishing truth consensus
	- this type of consensus allows us to build superintelligence on top
- TODO [[bootstraping superintelligence]]
- to dive into the idea here are some basic [concepts](cyber/concepts)
	- [[soft3]]
	- [[bootloader]]
	- [[collective learning]]
	- [[standard inference]]
	- [[truth oracle]]
	- [[unicon]]
	- [[cyber/techtree]]
- we decided to refer to any super intelligent computer as a [[dia]]
